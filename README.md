# IOT-based-health-Monitoring-System

IoT-based health monitoring systems have become increasingly important due to their ability to revolutionize healthcare by providing continuous, real-time data and enhancing patient care.
Some of the advantages are--
1) Continuous Monitoring
   IoT devices can monitor patients' health metrics continuously, such as    
   heart rate, blood glucose levels, and blood pressure.
   Benefit: Provides real-time data that can be used to detect health issues 
   early, potentially before symptoms become critical.

2) Early Detection and Prevention
   With continuous monitoring, changes in health indicators can be detected 
   quickly.Enables early intervention and preventative care, which can 
   reduce the risk of severe health events and improve overall health 
   outcomes.
   
3) Improved Patient Engagement
   IoT devices often come with user interfaces or mobile apps that engage 
   patients in their own health management. Encourages patients to be more 
   involved in their care, which can improve adherence to treatment plans 
   and lifestyle changes.

4) Emergency Response
   In the event of a critical health issue, IoT systems can trigger alerts 
   to healthcare providers or emergency services. Facilitates quicker 
   response times and potentially life-saving interventions.

Overall, IoT-based health monitoring systems are transforming healthcare by making it more proactive, efficient, and patient-centered. They bridge the gap between traditional in-person care and modern technological advances, leading to better health outcomes and enhanced quality of life.

Connections:
------------

1) Connect Pulse Sensor output pin to A0 of Arduino and other two pins to 
   VCC & GND.
2) Connect LM35 Temperature Sensor output pin to A1 of Arduino and other two 
   pins to VCC & GND.
3) Connect the LED to Digital Pin 7 of Arduino via a 220-ohm resistor.
4) Connect Pin 1,3,5,16 of LCD to GND.
5) Connect Pin 2,15 of LCD to VCC.
6) Connect Pin 4,6,11,12,13,14 of LCD to Digital Pin12,11,5,4,3,2 of Arduino.
7) The RX pin of ESP8266 works on 3.3V and it will not communicate with the 
   Arduino when we will connect it directly to the Arduino. So, we will have 
   to make a voltage divider for it which will convert the 5V into 3.3V. 
   This can be done by connecting the 2.2K & 1K resistor. Thus the RX pin of 
   the ESP8266 is connected to pin 10 of Arduino through the resistors.
8) Connect the TX pin of the ESP8266 to pin 9 of the Arduino.
